BookStoreProject is a simple ASP.NET Core MVC web application
that demonstrates the Model-View-Controller architecture by managing books in an online store. 
It includes basic CRUD operations, showing how models handle data, 
controllers manage logic and routing, and views display information to the user. 
The project was created to practice ASP.NET MVC concepts and 
understand how to build structured, maintainable web applications.
